Q. Explain the concept of concurrency
   -> Need
   -> Benifit
   -> Types
   -> Methods of implementation
   -> Explain concurrency using an example(take some example outside of the reading material provided)

ANSWER:
	Having 2 or more process working at a time is called concurrency.
NEED:
	-when we want to execute two different process togather at same time
	-when we want to have a backup of the program or its perticular resources then we can use concurrency.

BENIFITS:
	-decrease waiting and response time
	-better resource utilization
TYPES:
	to control concurrency:
		Mutex
		Semaphore
		Perterson's algorithm
METHODS:
	thread

EXAMPLE:
	Railway Networks - Railway tracks must be shifted only when a perticular train has passed through, and shifted before a perticular train uses it. Algorithm must be synchronised properly for this purpose.
